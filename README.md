# Course Number
ComS 309 - Software Development Practices

# Class Overview
ComS 309 was designed to teach students how to develop an Android only mobile application, essentially from scratch. This included creating a full backend, however, instruction was given from time to time to aid the development process. The application ideas were self-generated (each team came up with their own, which was then approved before development began). The class primarily uses Java, but does use some Gradle & Kotlin, as well as Android Studio for the frontend. The backend, however, uses tools such as Spring Boot & Maven and was written primarily in Java as well.

# Goal of the Project
We decided to create a mobile application named CyStaff, which would act as a central hub for all employee related actions at ISU. This included, but was not limited to, a calendar with fully functional events, login/sign-up, employee directory with filtering, user management (only for admins), live messaging, settings, announcements, and more. I was the primary frontend developer for this project as I developed the calendar, login, employee directory, user management, live messaging, and settings almost entirely myself, which consisted of over 18,000 lines of code, and I also developed a small amount of the backend files. I also developed automated testing for 70% coverage of the frontend files. With this, we received #2 Best Team and I got Top Coder.

# Notes
This was all completed in roughly 3 or so months, as the first month, or so, of the semester was spent getting familiar with tools, introductions, etc.
